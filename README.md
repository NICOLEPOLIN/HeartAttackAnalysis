# HeartAttackAnalysis
Heart Attack Prediction - SQL Project:
This project aims to predict the likelihood of a heart attack using a dataset containing various attributes of patients. ()
# Attribute Information:
1) age-Age of the patient (numeric)
2) sex-Gender of the patient (0 = female, 1 = male)
3) chest pain type (4 values)-Type of chest pain experienced by the patient (1 = typical angina, 2 = atypical angina, 3 = non-anginal pain, 4 = asymptomatic)
4) resting blood pressure
5) serum cholestoral in mg/dl
6)fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
7) resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)-Results of resting electrocardiogram (ECG) (0 = normal, 1 = having ST-T wave abnormality, 2 = showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy)
8) maximum heart rate achieved
9) exercise induced angina
10) oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11)the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
12) number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
13) thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect
14) target: 0= less chance of heart attack 1= more chance of heart attack.
 # Dataset:
The dataset used for this project can be found in the excel file i attached to this repository. It contains a total of n records,
where each record represents a patient with various attributes .

**This project involves performing various SQL queries on the dataset to gain insights and develop predictive models for heart attack likelihood. 
** the data for this project was taken from a survey that published on kaggle.

 # Data Visualization-
I haven't yet experienced data visualization,
but it's my next step in this project. I plan to learn data visualization tools such as Tableau, Power BI,
or Google Data Studio to visualize the results of the SQL queries and explore patterns in the dataset.
As I learn more about data visualization, I will implement the analysis results in these tools to create interactive and visually appealing visualizations.
